# DIWATA

## Project Description
DIWATA is a web-based book reservation platform developed for the VSU Learning Commons. 
The system allows students to check book availability, reserve materials online, and 
reduce the need for physical inquiries inside the library. It aims to improve resource 
accessibility, minimize waiting time, and modernize the current manual reservation process.
